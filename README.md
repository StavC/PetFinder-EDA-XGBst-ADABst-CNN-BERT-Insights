# Project Overview

Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world.

If homes can be found for them, many precious lives can be saved â€” and more happy families created.

In this Project i will uncover the Secrets behind pet adoption.

The whole project was created during my DataScience workshop course and is hosted in Kaggle
